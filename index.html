    <p>A bad friend does not keep a secret. They will always wander everywhere in school or at home or place of work spilling all your secrets.<br> This means they are hard to trust. A bad friend will spread your business to everyone with the intention of make people think they are better than you are.<br> Others because of jealousy will do this with the intention to hurt you or someone else. And because you trust them so much you may not be aware of their hidden agendas.</p>
